1. Set up Git on your local machine: create user and set up emails by using these two commands: 
  git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"
  git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"

2. Create new directory using "mkdir <project name>" command;
3. Use "cd <projectname>" command to switch into newly created directory;
4. Use "git init" to create Git project here. You can now create any files in that directory;
5. Use "git status" command to scan the directory for files; 
6. Use "git add <filename>" command to stage any file you want to commit further - you can use "git add --all" or "git add -A" to stage all directory at once;
7. Use "git commit -m <text messages >" to commit all staged changes;
8. To create new branch use "git branch <newBranchName>";
9. Your default branch name is what you set up on Step 1. To select newly created branch please use "git checkout <newBranchName>";
10. You can use "checkout" commands to freely switch between branches.
